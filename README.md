# sqrt2
Arbitrary precision pre-calculated values of Sqrt(2).

Everything is located in the directories `sqrt2` and `sqrt2hex`. To keep the data at a human-manageable size, the files are split into 25 000 digit chunks for decimal digits (in the `sqrt2` directory) with file names that start with `sqrt2+`, and into 16 kilobyte chunks for hexadecimal literal digits (in the `sqrt2hex` directory) with file names that start with `sqrt2hex+`.

Both versions have the part before the decimal point (which is `1`) dismissed.

You have permission to use this in your works, and you don't need to attribute me, but don't claim it as your own.
